    "The goal of this project is to help readers find books to read next that are aligned with their tastes. Although readers' opinions about books are subjective, I will be able to measure how well readers like or dislike books based on the ratings they give them on a five-star scale. A good solution will be one that maximizes the rating score readers give to the books selected for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project relies on the [goodbooks-10k dataset](http://fastml.com/goodbooks-10k-a-new-dataset-for-book-recommendations/), which was published under a Creative Commons license by Zygunt Zajac on the FastML website in 2017. The dataset includes about 6 million ratings of 10,000 books with the highest volume of ratings (ratings.csv). Each rating is associated with a user ID, making it possible to cluster individual readers based on their ratings. The dataset also includes metadata about each book, such as its title, author and average rating (books.csv)."

This could be because they already know what they like well enough that they select books they end up enjoying, because they don't want to give negative reviews, or because they've given relatively high scores to books they only somewhat enjoyed, and now they don't have much higher to go. Regardless, it appears that some readers aren't fully taking advantage of the 5-star scale."
